The Club grew steadily in the first ten years but it suffered a setback with the partition of India in 1947 when most of the members left Dhaka. The membership of the Club was reduced to only seven.

In 1950s and 60s, the Club made great progress of the membership rose to 57 in 1971 just before liberation.
